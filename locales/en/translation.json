  "intro": "Good evening, we are from Ukraine! In this difficult time it is extremely important to unite for a common goal - OUR VICTORY !!! Each of us tries to be useful to the Motherland and do everything in our power, and my friends and I are no exception. We organized a charity fund, which includes a group of volunteers who already had experience in purchasing and transporting cars for the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.",
  "explanation": "In order to maintain the high-quality combat capability of the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine during active hostilities, there is a need for rapid transportation of ammunition, food, as well as transportation of personnel. Since the active phase of the war is currently underway, there is a catastrophic lack of transport for the above purposes, so there is a need for conventional reliable cars with high off-road capability. Given the low cost of special military transport, you can buy more cars and provide them with more combat units.",
  "aim": "What do we offer? The main goal of the fund is to deliver the car to units that are in dire need of transport. Therefore, having talked to the military, we have contacts of people who are responsible for the units where these machines are needed.",
  "help": "How can you help us? If you have the opportunity - you can make your contributions. We would also be grateful for information about our foundation.",
