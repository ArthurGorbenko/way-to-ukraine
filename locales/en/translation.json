  "intro": "Good evening, we are from Ukraine! In this difficult time it is extremely important to unite for a common goal - OUR VICTORY !!! Each of us tries to be useful to the Motherland and do everything in our power, and my friends and I are no exception. We organized a charity fund, which includes a group of volunteers who already had experience in purchasing and transporting cars for the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.",
  "explanation": "In order to maintain the high-quality combat capability of the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine during active hostilities, there is a need for rapid transportation of ammunition, food, as well as transportation of personnel. Since the active phase of the war is currently underway, there is a catastrophic lack of transport for the above purposes, so there is a need for conventional reliable cars with high off-road capability. Given the low cost of special military transport, you can buy more cars and provide them with more combat units.",
  "aim": "What do we offer? The main goal of the fund is to deliver the car to units that are in dire need of transport. Therefore, having talked to the military, we have contacts of people who are responsible for the units where these machines are needed.",
  "help": "How can you help us? If you have the opportunity - you can make your contributions. We would also be grateful for information about our foundation.",

It came to us already while we were on our way to the cars for the military unit A4790üá∫üá¶ It was very unexpected for us to collect the following amount in such a quick time: ‚Ç¨14,000 in 2 days!!!! We have already finished the previous business trip: we brought 2 cars, painted them and managed to hand them over to the military. We don't waste time, every minute is very important now. Today we are leaving again! The goal is to bring 2 cars for the 126th battalion, for which you and I so quickly collected funds all together. In addition, originally we were supposed to provide 1 car, but you are so incredible and selfless that we will be able to bring 2 cars!!! Our team is infinitely grateful to everyone for your care and help, but ahead we plan to continue to help our defenders, so we are already planning a new collection. Everything will be UKRAINE",

  "posts.14.body": "These cars will get a bullet.Perhaps they will be shot at from a tank.Or maybe they will blow up on mines.They will travel 50 kilometers,or maybe several thousand. But they will definitely be blown up, they will definitely be left without wheels, or simply break, after completing their task.But we accomplished our task. We tested it, repaired it, painted it and gave it to our boys. Perhaps we will see videos of them storming enemy positions or evacuating the wounded. And maybe we won't see it...But one way or another, this miracle wouldn't have happened if it weren't for you, if it weren't for your reposts and donations. We thank everyone who participated and love you with all our hearts. You can throw a hryvnia at the next thief, who will surely be destroyed, but she is very necessary, here: ",

But we don't have time to wait anymore, because there are still people who need our help... The guys turned to us 120 brigades from the 173rd battalion were sent to hell in the Donetsk region on the front line... Since the first line of defense is under constant fire from tanks, mortars, artillery and MLRS, the guys need reliable and high-speed equipment. You and I have already done incredible things and helped many , but we need a little more miracle, in order to try to save the lives of the people who protect us... We need to raise 10,000‚Ç¨ to buy two cars for the boys. I am sure that you and I will be able to do it, because the Ukrainians of each of the day prove to the whole world that there is nothing incredible!!!
